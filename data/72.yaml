# Reddit was down and unreachable for 1.5 hours and slow to respond for 1.5 hours when an infrastructure upgrade involving Zookeeper and an autoscaler terminated many of their application servers in 16 seconds.

    # As we modernize our infrastructure, we may continue to perform different types of server migrations. Since this was due to a unique and risky migration that is now complete, we don’t expect this exact combination of failures to occur again. However, we have identified several improvements that will increase our overall tolerance to mistakes that can occur during risky migrations. 
    - This is about a rare operational action (not likely to need to be done again) but they still have AIs. Why? Because the incident demonstrated ways that various components (including people) behaved in an unsafe way under particular scenarios. And even if the migration will not be done again, there are other ways these scenarios ("mistakes") can occur and they want to tolerate those mistakes. And certain operations of the migration (disabling the package manager) are relevant more generally. [JS]
    - FDSE: Preventing similar, but not exact same combination of failures
    - Risk: Of similar from happening
    - Similar: Not sure if this exact thing will happen again

    # Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper, we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldn’t get confused about which servers should be available. It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it. Autoscaler read the partially migrated Zookeeper data and terminated many of our application servers, which serve our website and API, and our caching servers, in 16 seconds. [..] Make our autoscaler less aggressive by putting limits to how many servers can be shut down at once.
