    # At a high level, we suggest a focus on the following areas. This fuller remediation does have a deadline; the newly created intermediate certificate that resolved this incident is set to expire in 2025.
    - Effects of mitigation, requires action

    # Of course, defects in software cannot be completely eliminated
    - Mentality that defects will always exist

    # Tuning our Incident Command Process by looking at some of the following areas to create a more structured playbook:
    # Crisis levels and descriptions.
    # Phone numbers, back-ups and contact protocols.
    # Clear owners and roles.
    # Clear processes for incident kickoff, handoffs and documentation.
    # Template support responses that can be customized for each situation.
    # Documented safety response procedures.
    # Protocols to ensure we have things like passwords for social media accounts.
    # What are all the blogs and communication channels we have and when to use them.

    # Obviously could be more that one AI (but I'm going with "create a more structured playbook" as the AI)
