# A version upgrade of Venus Protocol (a block chain/financial product managed by a separate team of "community" developers) without the knowledge of Autofarm that introduced a new fee structure. "Although steps were taken to prepare for this event, our vaults were still unable to fully cater for this fee" and manual withdraw actions were required by users.

    # [Incident response was slow because] most of the team lives in the GMT+8 timezone [...] We will onboard more developers for more coverage on the different time zones so that the protocol has more bases covered even during the team’s wee hours.
