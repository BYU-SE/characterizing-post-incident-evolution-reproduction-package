    # We need a “down for maintenance” page that directs to twitter for updates. Not failing “halfway”, and leaving folks guessing what went wrong. For those of you that sent direct messages asking about this, I apologize. We should do better with this, and will look into running a basic maintenance page in Google Cloud Functions we can redirect to when things like this happen, planned or unplanned.

    motivation:
      experience: They were missing mechanism for customer communication and so customers were messaging the responder directly
      lifecycle:
        - Response / Customer communication
      tags:
        - human factors (clients were confused and messaging responder directly)
        - customer communication (missing, unclear about status)
      iso:
        - Self-descriptiveness

    item:
      action: Create "down for maintenance" page for redirect under duress
      target: Status Page (down for maintenance)
      goal: Fail fully (not halfway) and clearly communicate unavailability

      action-type:
        - evo / add
      target-type:
        - Incident response tools and process / Communication / Status Page
      sts:
        - Tech / Support
      intended-effect:
        - Interaction Capability / User assistance (status transparency)
      temporal: new
      google-ai:
        - mitigate future #/ improve response 

    other:
      modification: Add public status page component (down for maintenance)
      level: system

    memos:
      - Worded as lesson learned # "We need ..." but then "will look into"
      - Commitment: Wishy-washy language "will look into"
