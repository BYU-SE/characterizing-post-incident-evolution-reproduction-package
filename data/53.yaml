# An automated configuration generation system produced a bad configuration causing downtime to many systems, and then automatically cleared the defect and produced a good configuration 12 minutes later, causing the system to automatically recover

    # The issue has been resolved, and we’re now focused on correcting the bug that caused the outage, as well as putting more checks and monitors in place to ensure that this kind of problem doesn’t happen again.
    - Similarity: kind of problem using correction, checks, monitors

    # With services once again working normally, our work is now focused on (a) removing the source of failure that caused today’s outage, and (b) speeding up recovery when a problem does occur. We'll be taking the following steps in the next few days:
    - Post-incident work is different, focused on removing conditions and reducing impact for the next time

    # Engineers were still debugging 12 minutes later when the same system, having automatically cleared the original error, generated a new correct configuration at 11:14 a.m. and began sending it; errors subsided rapidly starting at this time. 
    - Graceful recovery: Having automatically cleared the error is a cool feature. Self-healing in a way; "causing the system to automatically recover".
