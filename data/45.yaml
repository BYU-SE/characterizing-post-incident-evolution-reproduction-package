# During maintenance, an error in the architecture and configuration caused layer 2 network loops to be introduced and interrupting services twice in one day. (about 20 minutes in total)

    - In general about this IR, it is pretty shallow. Almost an observation that they did something wrong (perhaps because they were not careful), and that they will simply use more care in the future.
    
    # Because of an incorrect assumption regarding the architecture that we have on our datacenters: FR-SD3, FR-SD5, and FR-SD6. The architecture design for these datacenters was conceived so that they would be independent.
    - RCA a good way to identify assumptions that were incorrect, including specifying what is their intention regardless of correctness.
