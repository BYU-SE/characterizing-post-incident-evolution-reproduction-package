    # To guard against the issue recurring and to reduce the impact of similar events, we are taking the following actions:
    - Similar: Exact and similar in the same sentence

    - Lots of focus on mitigating the future, perhaps because they realized that this should have been fixed very quickly (just rotate certs). Delay was caused, perhaps, by human actions (e.g. diagnosis, fix) and automated systems (emergency deployment took 2 hours)
