    - Across-Incident-Life-Cycle / TODO (not to related to each other):
      - AI-1 add safety check (addressing failure)
      - AI-2 parallelize restore operation (addressing slow recovery)

  AI-1: 
    # We’ve since added an additional layer of checks that require machines to locally verify their state before executing incoming commands. This enables machines that self-identify as running critical processes to refuse potentially destructive operations.

    motivation:
      experience: Maintenance operation applied to live servers due to script defect
      lifecycle:
        - Failure / Inception
      tags:
        - manual action (maintenance upgrade used script with a defect)
        - defect (in maintenance upgrade script, caused running machines to be shutdown)
      iso:
        - Faultlessness
    
    item:
      action: Add check/verification step on servers
      target: Infrastructure for database server
      goal: Ensure maintenance is only performed on inactive servers

      action-type:
        - evo / add
      target-type:
        - Fleets / Management systems
      sts:
        - Tech / Infra
      intended-effect:
        - Safety / Operational constraint

    # To speed up our recovery, we developed a tool that parallelizes the replay of binary logs. This enables much faster recovery from large MySQL backups. We plan to open source this tool so others can benefit from what we’ve learned.

    motivation:
      experience: Recovery was extended for several hours due to the large size of some databases
      lifecycle:
        - Failure / Recovery
      tags:
        - slow operation (recovery, replaying logs)
        - delayed recovery (replaying logs is slow)
      iso:
        - Recoverability
        - Time behavior
    
    item:
      action: Add new tooling that parallelizes operation
      target: Database backup and restore
      goal: Speed up restore from back up operation

      action-type:

      target-type:
        - Data stores / Backup and recovery
      target-sys: element
