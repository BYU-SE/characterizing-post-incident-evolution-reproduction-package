    - Everything is vague in this report

    # Due to an unprecedented traffic, we hit an internal rate limit with our service provider, and as a result, our scaling system was unable to create new instances for incoming users. Our existing servers were forced to accommodate existing as well new users, and this pressure caused all our servers to get clogged.
    - Scaling problem; at some point no one gets service

    # Unfortunately, it was not a straightforward way to increase limits with the service provider, and our team had to build a solution quickly to circumvent this issue. After working on it all night, we got the product back up at
