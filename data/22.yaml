# Description: "On June 17, at 08:32 UTC, our systems detected a significant packet loss between multiple destinations on one of our major transit provider backbone networks, Telia Carrier [...] Today, Jun 20, at 12:10 UTC, our systems again detected massive packet loss on one of our major transit provider backbone networks: Telia Carrier.

    # We understand how critical our infrastructure is for our customers’ businesses, and so we will continue to move towards completely automated systems to deal with this type of incident. Our goal is to minimize disruptions and outages for our customers regardless of the origin of the issue.
    - Automating resilience (gradually): Their long term trend is and has been resilience through automation, and AI-1 continues this trend. Specifically, resilience requires "increased failover capacity" and "automated detection and mitigation systems that can react much more quickly than any human operator". Their strategy has been to start with smaller locations "testing their accuracy and efficacy before turning them on for larger PoPs." One reason or the caution is that the mitigations in question "is not an easy decision" and so they are building trust gradually.

    # In today’s incident, we identified weaknesses in our communication: the scope of the incident was incorrectly identified in Europe only, and our response time was not adequate. We want to reassure you that we are taking all the steps to improve our communication, including implementation of automated detection and mitigation systems that can react much more quickly than any human operator. We already have such systems in place for our smaller data centers and are actively testing their accuracy and efficacy before turning them on for larger PoPs. We have been working on building a mechanism (which augments BGP) to proactively detect packet loss and move traffic away from providers experiencing packet loss. Because this system is currently activated only for our most remote and smallest locations, it didn't trigger in this morning’s incident. We plan to extend the capability in the next 2 weeks to switch from a manual reaction to an automatic one in all our POPs.

    motivation:
      experience: Packet drops happened for 20 minutes before manual response was taken
      lifecycle:
        - Response / Detection
        - Response / Mitigation
      tags:
        - delayed response (failure occurred before any response was taken)
        - manual action required (to fail over)
        - missing automation (had some in small data centers but hadn't been turned on for larger PoPs)
        - opportunistic (had existing system which was being developed which would fit well to address this)
