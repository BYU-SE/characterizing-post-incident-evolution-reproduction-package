#
# Traffic to all parts of the Deno service (cdn, website, package manager file, etc) was blocked by Cloudflare, which had misidentified .ts files as media, and was likely triggered by an influx in traffic (9x regular traffic) after Deno posted release notes on Hacker News

  memos:
    - Very blamey incident on Cloudflare

    - No further action taken internally besides mitigating factors like moving to fly.io (how is that better than cloudflare?)

    - No core changes needed: They just added a status page which doesn't do any prevention. They could have kept both infrastructure providers and added a fallback or something, but they chose to do nothing

  # Cloudflare has also assured us that a 16 hour gap between false detection and remediation is not acceptable, and that this will be an area of immediate focus for them.

  # excluded: Reporting on a third party with only details that action will be taken, but not what specific actions.

    # [Lots of things went down] As a result of this incident we have set up a public status page. This page shows the current status of deno.land/x, deno.land/std, cdn.deno.land, and api.deno.land. You can view it at https://status.deno.land/.
