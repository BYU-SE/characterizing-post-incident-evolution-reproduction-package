    # On May 30, a minute after 10:48 UTC when the certification authorities expired, our Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team got notified that there was a certificate problem with our service. This was an unexpected message because we carefully check that our certificates are valid and don’t expire any time soon. [..] we're improving our certificate checking tool to verify expiration in the full chain, not just our leaf certificate
