# Instability in their storage infrastructure (SAN) was caused by ongoing performance limitations. The storage got too full too keep up with demands and had to be shutdown and cleaned. The service operated with reduced capacity for an extended time.

    # Ongoing performance limitations with our current shared SAN platform were leading to hypervisor host instability. SAN storage got too full to be able to keep up with our I/O demands. Weâ€™re currently working with our infrastructure provider on a new dedicated SAN platform which will bring dedicated capacity with faster storage and increased storage network throughput.

    # Over time the amount of used space on our SAN LUNs had grown. We had initially attributed this to our overall growth in usage and concurrent load, and realized too late that due to the host instability mentioned above, we were accumulating orphaned folders/files on the SAN that were not visible to existing cleanup processes. This reduction in free space hit a point where there was too little space for the SAN to be able to keep up with our peak load. [..] Through the cleanup process, we developed a set of scripts which were able to help us identify and cleanup orphaned files/folders. While we anticipate that improvements from the new SAN platform will be sufficient enough to prevent the accumulation of orphaned files/folders in the future, we plan to utilize some of these scripts to do reporting and generate metrics to measure and verify that the new SAN platform brings the improvements we expect.

    motivation:
      experience: Orphaned folders and files on SAN used up space over a long period of time, and eventually reached a point where there was too little space to keep up with peak load

      tags:
        - high load (peak load, with limited file space the SAN platform was unable to keep up with serving this load)
        - limit hit (file space consumed, SAN was unable to keep up with peak load)
